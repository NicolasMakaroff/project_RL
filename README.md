# RL Project on Conservative Exploration

This project proposes a model-free algorithm for the problem of conservative exploration in RL in the finite-horizon setting. The approach is an adaptation with theoretical guarantees of OPTIMISTs algortihms via multiple importance sampling. <br>
Also, a heuristic version of the algorithm called evolOpt (evolutionary OPTIMIST) attains subliner cumulative regret after a reasonable number of episodes.
